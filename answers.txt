a.there are ~50 articles, we estimate that searching manually each article
consume 10 minutes. Hence, the task will take ~8-9 hours (500 minutes) .
using our script saves lots of time (1 minute over 500 minutes)
and it is more reliable.

b.We can apply this principle in searching and editing articles, books etc.
For example, we can write a script that counts and print our current open tasks
in each course on Moodle.

c.In order to run the script every hour we can do it automatically by using
the "watch" command (otherwise we should run manually the script every time).
We can handle with old articles by making new links and result file in each 
run. More efficient option will be to compare the previous links to each link
of the current run. After that the script will run only over our new links
and add it's result to the previous result file.
